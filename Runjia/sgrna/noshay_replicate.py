"""Reproduce the inherited paper's own model, as its methods section describes it.

Everything in this project is measured against a *baseline* built from Noshay et
al.'s feature matrix with our own XGBoost. That is not the same as reproducing
*their model*, and until now the 0.502 in the comparison table was a number read
off their Table 1 rather than one we had seen happen. This module runs their
algorithm.

What the paper specifies (NAR 51:10147, 'Iterative Random Forest Model' and
Table 1):

  * iterative Random Forest (iRF), their Ranger-based implementation at
    github.com/jailGroup/RangerBasediRF
  * **1,000 decision trees per forest, ten iterations**
  * **five-fold cross-validation**, each run an 80/20 train/test split
  * the full 6,232-column matrix: one-hot positional encoding plus the quantum
    chemical tensors
  * reported for E. coli, full matrix: **R² 0.2491, Pearson 0.5019**

Two honest gaps between that and what can be run here, both of which belong in
any statement of the result:

  1. **Their row count is not reproducible from their own release.** Table 1
     says 40,468 sgRNAs (32,374 train); the published supplementary matrix
     covers 13,880. We run 13,880, so a lower score is expected and is not
     evidence their figure was wrong.
  2. **This is a reimplementation, not their code.** iRF as published (Basu et
     al., PNAS 2018) iterates a forest in which each tree's candidate features
     are drawn with probability proportional to the previous iteration's
     importances; that is what `_irf_fit` does, with scikit-learn trees. Their
     Ranger build will differ in details.

**One deviation that matters if you reuse this.** `_grow` draws `mtry` columns
**once per tree** and then grows the whole tree inside that subspace, rather than
resampling candidates at every split as a true random forest does. The
reweighting mechanism needs the candidate set chosen externally, so this is the
natural way to implement iRF — but it means **absolute `mtry` sets tree
capacity**, and `sqrt(p)` is therefore not portable across matrices of different
width. Measured on the same rows and fold
(`results/irf_mtry_sweep.csv`): on the 427-column reduced basis, `mtry` =
sqrt(427) = 20 scores rho **0.275**, while `mtry` = 78 — matching the
full-matrix arm's sqrt(6232) — scores **0.489**, against **0.495** for the full
6,232 columns. Same information, same algorithm, 0.21 of Spearman between them,
entirely from how many columns each tree was allowed to see. Compare iRF across
column counts at **matched absolute `mtry`**, never at matched sqrt(p).
