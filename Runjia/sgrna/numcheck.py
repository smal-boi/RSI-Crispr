"""Check every number in the documents against the result files.

Two layers, because the first alone is too weak:

  coverage    -- does this number exist anywhere in `results/`?  Catches
                 invented, mistyped or stale figures.
  attribution -- when a line cites a specific file, do that line's numbers
                 appear in THAT file?  Catches a correctly-copied number quoted
                 against the wrong experiment.

An earlier version checked literals only and flagged 95 attribution misses,
almost all of them Delta-rho claims -- a difference between two rows of the
cited file, which is not itself a literal in it. A checker that cannot see a
difference cannot check this report, since most of its claims ARE differences.

So each cited file contributes:

    its literals, every pairwise difference of its literals, and every ratio.

That is a wide net and will pass some numbers by coincidence, which is the right
trade: the output is a shortlist to read, not a verdict. It does not compute
means, so a figure that averages several rows will be flagged and is usually
fine; what it is for is the figure that belongs to a different experiment.
