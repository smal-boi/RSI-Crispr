# Results — claim to evidence

This file is an **index**, not a narrative. For every claim the progress report
makes, it names the file that backs it and the command that produced it, so any
number in the report can be checked without reading the report.

The narrative lives in [`../docs/PROGRESS_REPORT.md`](../docs/PROGRESS_REPORT.md);
the chronology, including claims later withdrawn, lives in
the shared repository's git history.

**What is indexed:** results a claim rests on. That includes nulls when the null
*is* the claim — the dCas9 screen, the periodicity family, the shift control —
because a ruled-out mechanism is a result.

**What is not indexed:** exploratory sweeps, superseded runs, tangential
questions, per-fold dumps (`folds_*.csv`), per-run settings (`*_settings.json`)
and prediction dumps (`preds_*.csv`). Those files are still here and still
readable; they are just not load-bearing. The long-form commentary written up to
10 October 2026 is kept verbatim in
[`RESULTS_archive_2026-10-10.md`](RESULTS_archive_2026-10-10.md).

**Which cohort a number belongs to.** The project pivoted on 13 October 2026 from
Noshay's published 13,880-row matrix and `cut.score` to crisprHAL 2's curated
33,567-guide release and its ALDEx2 score. Both frames appear below and are
marked **[P]** published or **[C]** curated. They are not interchangeable.

## The one large effect

| claim | number | frame | evidence | command |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flanking DNA composition is the largest effect measured here | +0.164 ρ | [C] | `ablation_curated.csv` | `python -m sgrna.curated_ablation --all` |
| …and +0.080 on the published matrix, so the effect is not an artefact of the pivot | +0.080 ρ | [P] | `ablation_main.csv` | `python -m sgrna.run_ablation` |
| It survives holding out whole genes, losing only the grouping tax | 6% tax | [C] | `ablation_curated_gene.csv`, `grouped_retention.csv` | `python -m sgrna.curated_ablation --all --grouping gene`; `python -m sgrna.rederive --only grouped_retention` |
| It is spatially local: a texture-preserving circular shift destroys it | 8% at 1 kb, 0 at 10 kb | [P] | `shift_null.csv` | `python -m sgrna.shiftnull` |
| It is a smooth gradient, not a motif: k-mer order buys nothing | tetramers −0.0019 | [C] | `curated_ladder.csv`, `kmer_order_noselect.csv` | `python -m sgrna.curated_ladder`; `python -m sgrna.rederive --only kmer_order_noselect` |
| The window widths are not where the gain lives | +0.1634 vs +0.1638 | [C] | `window_robustness.csv` | `python -m sgrna.window_robustness` |
| It is not target GC in disguise: conditioning raises it | +0.044 → +0.082 | [P] | `gc_strata_corr.csv`, `gc_strata_ablation.csv` | `python -m sgrna.gcstrata` |
| It is not gene ranking: it holds inside genes | +0.061 within-gene | [P] | `ablation_grouped.csv` | `python -m sgrna.run_ablation --grouping gene` |
| It is not read depth or mappability | +0.078 → +0.051 | [P] | `ablation_abund_split.csv` (`abund_local_vs_mappability.csv` †) | `python -m sgrna.run_ablation --tag abund_split` |

## The representation

| …and the one apparent winner is capacity, not grow policy: `max_depth` 6 beats 4 | +0.0063 [+0.0053, +0.0073], 15/15 folds | [C] | `xgb_knobs_verify.csv` | `python -m sgrna.xgb_knobs --verify` |
| The folding gain is the **real structure**: position-shuffled folds are a null | +0.0119 vs −0.0002 over 3 permutations | [C] | `redescription_folds.csv` | `python -m sgrna.redescription --arm folds` |
| `d_mechanics`'s outside half is provenance, not non-linearity | 8 flank cols +0.0968; 2 guide-only +0.0019 | [C] | `redescription_provenance.csv` | `python -m sgrna.redescription --arm provenance` |
| Chi sites are indistinguishable from any GC-matched octamer — the RecBCD repair route is excluded | 41st percentile of 200 controls | [C] | `chi_sites.csv` | `python -m sgrna.chi_sites` |
| **The dCas9 null does not localise the effect to cleavage**: inside the CRISPRi screen's essential genes family A is worth +0.27 | +0.2679 (100 kb blocks), +0.2749 (gene-grouped) vs −0.0101 non-essential | [C] | `cui_essentiality_split.csv` | `python -m sgrna.cui_screen --essentiality` |
| Flank GC conditioning, re-measured on the curated cohort | +0.176 marginal → +0.221 partial; positive in all 5 strata | [C] | `gc_strata_corr_curated.csv` | `python -m sgrna.gcstrata --corr --cohort curated` |
| Flank GC's marginal association is 3.6× stronger on the curated cohort than the published one | +0.161 vs +0.044 | [C] | — (`gcstrata.py` is pre-pivot) | `python -m sgrna.gcstrata --corr` |
| Noshay's quantum columns beat every k-mer encoding of the same bases | +0.0114 | [C] | `curated_ladder.csv` | `python -m sgrna.curated_ladder` |

| `d_mechanics`'s gain is flanking DNA, not re-description | +0.097 of +0.099 | [C] | `no_information.csv`, `d_mechanics_reconstructibility.csv` | `python -m sgrna.no_information`; `python -m sgrna.rederive --only d_mechanics_reconstructibility` |
| Model class barely matters, with or without the one real effect | 0.1076 ρ over 8 classes | [C] | `curated_models.csv` | `python -m sgrna.curated_models` |
| Summing the family table would overstate it 3.5× | +0.2030 against +0.7046 | [C] | `curated_joint.csv` | `python -m sgrna.curated_joint` |

## Against the state of the art

## † Files whose producer was lost, and what re-deriving them found

Thirteen files cited above were written by code no longer in `src/` or `colab/`.
`python -m sgrna.rederive` now reproduces twelve of them from committed code and
**compares rather than overwrites** — re-derivation is a check, and the stored
file stays authoritative. Verdicts in `results/rederivation_check.csv`, outputs
in `results/rederived/`:

| file | verdict |
|---|---|
| `grouped_retention.csv` | **exact** |
| `selector_control.csv` | **exact** |
| `final_eval_metric_bootstrap.csv` | **exact** point estimates; CIs differ by bootstrap noise only |
| `portability_364.csv` | agrees, 0.2% |
| `kmer_order_noselect.csv` | agrees, 0.2% |
| `dissection_supercoiling.csv` | agrees on the claim (control ≥ signal), 1.2%; the stored arm names and `bin100k` grouping could not be reconstructed |
| `their_split_slicer.csv` | agrees, ρ 0.6997 against 0.6985; all metrics within 0.004 except a top-10 statistic |
| `d_mechanics_reconstructibility.csv` | agrees in distribution, median 0.832 against 0.845; the file is keyless so rows cannot be aligned |
| `additivity_reduced.csv` | **two of four arms exact, two wrong** — see below |
| `abund_local_vs_mappability.csv` | **not reproducible**: the definition of its `uniq` columns is lost. Five candidates were tried and none comes near the stored values (its `control.w10000` / `uniq.w10000` cell is −0.694; windowed exact-20-mer uniqueness gives −0.08, mean `unique_in_genome` −0.06, mean `n_genome_copies` +0.06, guide density −0.05, and the same at 2 kb). The stored quantity grows in magnitude with window width, which suggests it was derived from read data rather than from the genome — do not spend more time guessing it |
| `seqnet_matched.csv` | **exact on all four arms, all 20 folds** (f100 0.5203, f250 0.5247, f500 0.5214, f1000 0.5190 — zero difference to four decimals). `python -m sgrna.seqnet --flank {100,250,500,1000} --out results/rederived/seqnet_matched.csv` |
| `matched_search_folds.csv` | **agrees to 0.0001** — it is a join of four local files, not a GPU artefact, and is now re-derived as one |
| `crisprhal_matched_folds.csv` | the only genuine GPU artefact. `colab/crisprhal_tune_matched.py` now writes it under exactly that name with the `is_published_config` flag, so a rerun reproduces it — but the rerun needs a T4 |

**The exercise paid for itself.** `additivity_reduced.csv`'s two reduced arms
re-derive to within 0.0007 (and its XGBoost column bit-identically), but its two
full-matrix arms do not: the stored "ridge on the raw 6,232 collapses to 0.423"
holds only at `alpha=1`, and a penalty search gives **0.4945**. That claim is
withdrawn in the report. A number nobody can regenerate is a number nobody can
argue with — which is exactly what happened to `human_transfer.csv`.

## Reproducing any row

Every command above assumes `pip install -e .` and the data layout in
[`../README.md`](../README.md). Seeds are fixed (41–45) and every table here was
produced by the committed code in [`../src/sgrna`](../src/sgrna); the two
GPU-dependent rows run on free Colab from [`../colab`](../colab). The harness
check is `ablation_main.csv`'s baseline row, which must reproduce R² 0.2937 /
ρ 0.5278 to four decimal places before any other number is trusted.
